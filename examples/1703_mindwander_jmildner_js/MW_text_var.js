'<p class=cent> Not everybody has a garden. Some deny themselves the pleasure and the profit of one because they have never had any experience in gardening, and have somehow got the impression that special training is necessary to make a success of the undertaking. Here is where they make a mistake. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There is no special "knack" about it. Any one who owns a bit of land, and has some time that can be given to garden work, and an inclination to do so, can make a gardener of themselves in a season--and a successful one, too--if they allow themselves to be governed by the advice of someone who has had some experience along this line. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> After the first season they will not be likely to ask or need advice, for the practical knowledge which comes with one season\'s work among vegetables will not only be sufficient to enable them to go on with their gardening operations on their own responsibility, but it will have made them so enthusiastic over them that they will be eager to enlarge their knowledge of "the green things growing." </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In doing this they will find a pleasure that will make them wonder how they ever came to consider gardening something to dread. Others, who have but a small piece of land, may think it not worth while to attempt to grow vegetables on it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> They labor under the impression that a garden, in order to prove a success, requires more land than is at their disposal. Here is where they make a mistake. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Of course one cannot grow a large quantity of vegetables on a small piece of ground, but the one who undertakes to make the most of a small piece will be surprised at the amount that can be grown on it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In a garden that is not more than twenty-five feet square a friend of mine grows all the summer vegetables required by their family of four persons. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This calls for what the scientific people call "intensive gardening," and makes it necessary to plant and plan for a succession of vegetables; but that twenty-five feet square of ground enables them to get a good share of the summer living of their family. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Another notion is, that in order to have a good garden a large amount of time and labor must be expended on it. Not so. A very small amount of systematized labor will be demanded by even a good-sized garden, if it is planned in such a manner that labor-saving tools can be used in its cultivation. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If we look back to the gardening days of fifty or even twenty-five years ago, when everything was done at the hardest and the hand had to do a good share of the work that we now do with helpful implements, it is not to be wondered at that the old-time care of a garden discourages many from undertaking to have one. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Happily those days are over, and with the gardening facilities of the present it is an easy matter to accomplish more in an hour than could be done then in a day. There is really no drudgery in gardening as it is done today. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> On the contrary, there is positive pleasure in the operation of the machinery which inventive genius has furnished for the up-to-date gardener\'s use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Those who have never had a garden of their own, but have bought vegetables in the ordinary market, are not in a position to understand the wide difference between the article we buy and the one which is taken directly from the ground and eaten at once. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> While it is possible to keep most vegetables looking fresh for a considerable time by the use of water and ice, it is not possible to make them retain that delicacy of flavor known only to those whose vegetables go straight from the garden to the kitchen. If you want any vegetable at its best you must grow it in your own garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I have often been told by those who have had years of experience in garden work that at least half one\'s living for half the year can be obtained from the garden, even if it happens to be a small one, and my own experience bears out the truth of this statement. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If we grow our own vegetables we are quite sure to have a greater variety to add to the daily bill of fare than would be the case if we were to buy them. We have them when we want them without making a trip to the market for them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> No owner of a bit of ground that can be made into a garden can afford to let it remain unused. If they do so they do it in disregard of the economy which most of us are obliged to consider and practice in these days of high prices and the increasing cost of daily living. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Have a garden if you can. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I. GETTING THE GARDEN READY </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The amateur gardener will almost invariably be in too great a hurry to begin gardening operations in the spring. But a few warm days are not sufficient to put the ground in proper condition for seeding, or even for plowing and spading. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The frost must be allowed to get out of it, and after that an opportunity must be given for surplus water from melting snows and spring rains to drain away before work can be done to any advantage. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> As a general thing not much can be done in gardening in the North before the first of May. It is an old saying that "haste makes waste," and the gardener who is in too great a hurry often learns the truth which underlies the saying by the failure to germinate of the seed they put into the ground very early in the season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Another old saying that should be kept in mind is that "one swallow does not make a summer." Read "warm day" for "swallow" and you will get the force of the statement. It is not advisable to do much at gardening until you are reasonably sure that warm weather has come to stay. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Even if early-planted seed comes up, spells of cold weather, and often of frost, which we are likely to have in the North until about the first of May, will have such a debilitating effect on comparatively hardy plants that those grown from later sowings, when all conditions are favorable, will come to maturity ahead of them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Therefore it will be seen that it is poor policy to be in too great a hurry, and good policy to wait for what the farmer calls "growing weather" before doing much work in the garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If very early vegetables are wanted it will be necessary to start them in the hotbed. In another chapter I will give some directions for the making and management of this very important adjunct of gardening. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The first thing to do in making a garden is to plow or spade it. Plowing is not admissible on small grounds, but where there is room enough to allow a team and plow to operate I would advise it in preference to spading, because it will save a good deal of hard work, and greatly expedite matters. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Before plowing some system of manuring should be decided on, as whatever fertilizer is used should be worked well into the soil, and this the plow can do most effectively. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Barn-yard manure, if old and well rotted, is better than anything else I have any knowledge of for all kinds of vegetables, but unfortunately it is seldom obtainable by those who do not live in the country. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There are many commercial fertilizers on the market, but not all kinds of them are adapted to all kinds of soil. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In order to secure the best results it is advisable that the amateur gardener should consult some dealer in these fertilizers in their immediate vicinity, or some one who has had personal experience in their use, with a view to making sure that they are getting just the kind best adapted to the soil in their garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is absolutely necessary that they should do this, in fact, for if they buy at random they run the risk of getting something that will fail to answer their purpose. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> While it is always advisable to apply whatever fertilizer is used before plowing, commercial fertilizers can be applied later with good effect; but it will be necessary to apply them in such a manner that they do not come directly into contact with the seed, as many of them are so strong that they kill it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Plow the garden deeply, for by so doing you bring to the surface a stratum of soil in which there is more latent fertility than in that close to the surface. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> After plowing, allow the soil to remain as thrown up from the furrow for two or three days. Sunshine and warm air will have a disintegrating effect on it, which will make it easy for you to reduce it under the application of hoe and iron rake to that mellow condition so necessary to the welfare of the plants you propose to grow. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It should be worked over and over until not a lump is left in it. You cannot expect to grow good vegetables in a soil that has not been well pulverized before seed is planted. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Large grounds can be speedily mellowed with the harrow, which should be run over the ground from all directions until it is thoroughly pulverized. In the small garden the rake and hoe will have to take the place of the harrow. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Small pieces of ground should be spaded. Let the soil remain as thrown up by the spade for two or three days before attempting to work it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I have been told by some amateur gardeners that they did not use much manure because trees and shrubs that grew in close proximity to their gardens were so thrifty without manuring that they felt confident that the soil must be quite rich enough for vegetables without resorting to the use of any fertilizer. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> These persons lacked the experience which would have enabled them to understand the wide difference between tree and vegetable growth. A tree or a bush sends its roots deeply and widely into the soil, and applies to its uses food that the vegetable cannot send its roots in search of. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The roots of most garden plants do not extend far in any direction, nor go very deep; therefore food must be given directly to them if we would secure the best possible result. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There are very few gardens in which the natural soil has a sufficient amount of nutriment to produce the effect we aim at without the addition of some kind of plant-food. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A rich soil is absolutely necessary in order to hasten development. Unless a vegetable makes a quick growth it is pretty sure to be lacking in tenderness and flavor. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Of course it is possible to apply a greater amount than a plant can make use of, thus forcing an unhealthy growth, but this is not likely to happen if we consult the wise old gardener who knows their garden and the plants they grow in it as a mechanic knows the machine they use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> II. LAYING OUT THE GARDEN </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There will be little "laying out" to do in the small garden. Here the chief aim will be to make use of every available bit of soil; the beds will be narrow, and the paths between them will be just wide enough to walk in, and these will be the only portions of the ground in which something is not grown. Not much chance for planning, you see. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In the larger garden it will be not only possible, but advisable, to do considerable planning. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If a garden-cultivator is used--and this should be done whenever possible--plan for rows that will enable you to run it the entire length of the garden without turning. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Beds are no longer in favor with gardeners who aim to reduce the work to be done to the minimum, for in them the cultivator cannot be used to advantage, and weeding cannot be done with the facility which characterizes row-planting, nor can the hoe be used as effectively. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There is really no argument that can be advanced in favor of the old bedding system for gardens in which we propose to use labor-saving implements. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If possible, have the rows run north and south. This enables the sun to get at the ground lengthwise of the rows, and between them, which it could not do if they ran east and west, as the plants in them would shade all the ground except that in the first and most southerly row. It is not enough that the sun should get at the tops of the plants. The soil needs its vivifying effect. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Plant with regard to the height and habit of the vegetables you propose to grow. Give corn a place at the side of the garden. Then peas which grow tall enough to require bushing, and then beans, working down through potatoes, tomatoes, and beets and other low-growing kinds to onions, radishes, and cucumbers. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If the garden-cultivator is to be used, leave a space about eighteen inches wide between the rows to work in. This implement can be adjusted to fit any width desired. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Its teeth can be set to throw the soil toward a plant or away from it. It can be made to do deep or shallow work, as the case may require. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> As a general thing, after a plant has attained some size we throw the soil toward it. If the teeth are set to do this we go down one side of the row and back on the other, thus throwing the soil about the plant alike on both sides. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It will probably be necessary to remove some weeds in the row, which cannot be reached by the cultivator. This can be done most effectively by the use of a hoe which is triangular in shape, with the handle-socket in the center of it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> One side is a blade like the ordinary hoe. The other comes to a sharp point, with which it is possible to work close to a plant without running any risk of injuring it--something that cannot be done with the ordinary wide-bladed hoe. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Weeds that grow up side by side with vegetable seedlings can be picked away from them so easily, and without disturbing them in the least, that no hand-pulling will have to be resorted to in cleaning the rows. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Where the garden-cultivator is used there will be very little work to do with the hoe, as this implement stirs the soil and uproots weeds at the same time. But in the small garden either hoe or weeding-hook will come into daily use. The weeding-hook is a most important tool. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It enables one to do a good deal of weeding in a short time, does its work well, and does away entirely with hand-pulling, which has heretofore been one of the chief arguments that people have advanced against gardening. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> III. PLANTING THE GARDEN </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Most persons make the serious mistake of covering garden seed too deeply. Very small seed needs hardly any covering. Indeed, it does its best, as a general thing, when simply scattered on the surface and pressed down into the soil by a smooth board. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This embeds the seed in the soil, which is made firm enough under the pressure of the board to retain a sufficient amount of moisture to assist germination. Very fine seed often fails to sprout if covered too deeply. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But most of the seed of garden vegetables is not fine enough to admit of this method of planting. If a seed-sower is not used, little furrows should be made by drawing a stick through the soil, into which the seed should be dropped as evenly as possible. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It should then be covered lightly and the soil should be pressed down with the hoe to make it comparatively firm. The probabilities are that many more plants will come up than it is advisable to let grow. These surplus seedlings should be removed from the rows as soon as the plants get a good start. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Nearly all gardeners make use of the seed-sower. This is an implement that can be adjusted to sow all kinds of seed more evenly than it can be sown by hand, and it can be sown thickly or thinly, as desired, and at any required depth. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It cannot be used to much advantage in the very small garden, where only a small quantity of each kind of seed will be made use of, but in large gardens it will be found as much a labor-saver as the garden-cultivator. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is always advisable to plant for a succession if the garden is large enough to admit of it. By planting at intervals of ten days or two weeks it is possible to have fresh vegetables throughout almost the entire season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Where this is done it will not be advisable to plant very much of any one kind. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Among almost all vegetables there are early, medium, and late varieties. Some of each of these should be planted in all gardens of a size to warrant so doing. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In the small garden I would advise the choice of the later varieties, as these are almost without exception superior in flavor to the earlier kinds, which are grown more on account of earliness than quality. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> IV. SEEDS THAT GIVE BEST RESULTS </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is very important that seed of only the best kind should be used, if we would grow vegetables of superior quality. Every gardener of experience will indorse the truth of this statement. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Said one amateur gardener to me when I gave them this advice: "Why should one be so particular about the seed? It\'s the culture that you give the plant that counts. Plant any kind of seed that happens to be handiest and take good care of the plants that grow from it and you\'ll have good vegetables." </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> To some extent what they said was true, but they had yet to learn that there is a vast difference between ordinary seed and seed that has bred into it by careful culture the superior qualities which characterize the choicest varieties of all our garden plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There is such a thing as aristocracy of seed, and no seed that is lacking in this feature can be expected to afford the satisfaction that results from the use of the best. No amount of culture can make a superior vegetable from plants grown from inferior seed. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Bear this in mind, and buy only the best seed on the market, be your garden large or small. The smaller it is, the greater the importance of using only the best. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> "But how are we who know very little about such things to know which is the best?" some one may ask. The only answer I can make to this question is this: </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> We have in this country many seed firms that have been in existence for years--some of them over half a century--and these have built up for themselves a reputation for handling only seed of the very best varieties of garden vegetables that it is possible to grow. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Inferior sorts have been discarded from time to time as those of superior merit have been produced. These firms, proud and jealous of the reputation they have gained, cannot afford to deal in anything that is not up to their standard of "the best." </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> From these dealers you can be sure of getting seed that can always be depended on to give the highest degree of satisfaction. The seed they sell you may cost a little more than some of the newer dealers ask for theirs, but the certainty of getting what you want makes it well worth while to invest some extra money in it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Cheap seed--that which is advertised as being "just as good as higher-priced seed for a much smaller amount of money"--is likely to prove as cheap in quality as in price. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> V. EARLY GARDEN WORK </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> After planting the garden there will be a little interval of leisure while the seed that has been put into the ground is germinating. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Then will come the time of early warfare with the weeds. Here is where the weeding-hook of which I have spoken will come into play in the small garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This little implement is in the form of a claw, with five or six fingers, each about an inch long, and shaped so that they reach into the ground and take a firm hold of whatever plants they are placed over. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It can be so operated that these fingers, working close to plants which it is not desired to uproot, will tear away the weeds without disturbing the other plants, and the soil will be left in light and mellow condition, as if a tiny rake had been drawn through it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> With this tool the work can be done with great rapidity. No owner of a garden, large or small, can afford to be without it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It should be used to supplement the work of the cultivator, which can be depended upon to take care of all the weeds between the rows, but which cannot be worked among the plants in the row. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Weeding should be begun as soon as the plants are of a size that makes it possible to tell which is seedling and which is weed. By beginning the work of clearing the garden at this period, and doing it thoroughly, and continuing it at intervals thereafter, it will be a comparatively easy matter to keep weeds under control. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But if they are allowed to get a strong start--as they will in an incredibly short time if let alone--it will be a difficult matter to subdue them and keep the upper hand during the rest of the season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is very important that they should be given to understand, at the outset, that they will not be tolerated in your garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This will necessitate early work and careful and regular attention thereafter, but it will not be the laborious work that so many persons think it is if it is begun at the right season and always carried on on the offensive. It is when weeds have been allowed to entrench themselves firmly in the garden that this work becomes disagreeable. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Nor is it work that will require a good deal of one\'s time. In the cultivation of a garden it is the little attentions, given when needed, that count, rather than the amount of labor and time expended there, as you will find when you come to have a garden of your own. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If there are any vacant places in the beds or rows, fill with plants taken from places where they stand too thick. In the small garden there should be not one vacant spot. Every bit of soil should be made to do its share of work in the production of some vegetable. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If weeds are kept down during the early part of the season there ought not to be many during the latter part of it. But there will be no time when there will not be some to wage warfare against, and every gardener should make it a rule to destroy every one that gets a start as soon as discovered. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> By preventing it from developing seed, we can save ourselves a good deal of work next season. One weed will bear seed enough to fill the whole garden with its progeny if allowed to do so. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If the soil was properly fertilized at planting-time it will not be necessary to apply more fertilizer, if any, until the latter part of the season, and then only a small amount will be required--just enough to enable the soil to do its share in ripening off the plants that are growing in it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But if, at any time, the plants seem to lag or come to a standstill enough should be given to stimulate active growth. Careful watch should be kept of everything in the garden, and prompt advantage should be taken of any tendency toward slow development by making fresh applications of whatever fertilizer was used at the beginning of the season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In order to attain the success that the gardener aims at in the cultivation of vegetables it is absolutely necessary to keep them going steadily ahead from start to finish, and this can only be done by supplying them with a generous amount of plant-food. There should be no alternations of liberal feeding and lack of feeding. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> VI. VEGETABLE PLANTS IN THE HOUSE </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Many persons would like to grow early vegetables. With a view to "getting the start of the season" and, incidentally, of their neighbors, they sow seed in pots and boxes in March and April and attempt to get an "early start" for plants that will form a basis of supply for family use while they are waiting for the development of the general crop from seed sown in the garden after the weather has become sufficiently warm to warrant outdoor gardening. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In some instances comparative success has resulted from plants started into growth in the house, but nine times out of ten, it is safe to say, the result has been entire failure. The seedlings grow fairly well at first, but soon become weak and die. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If, by chance, a few survive until conditions warrant putting them in the ground, they are so lacking in vitality that the change from indoors to outdoors is pretty sure to be the end of them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I would never advise trying to grow plants from seed, in the house, unless the grower understands beforehand the drawbacks to plant-growth which prevail in the average dwelling, and is willing to do all they can to overcome them. Simply filling boxes or pots with earth, putting seed into them, and supplying water will not ensure success. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> One of the unfavorable conditions which seedling plants must struggle against is too much heat, if they are kept in the living-room. An undue amount of warmth forces them into abnormal development in the early stages of their growth, and a little later on there comes a reaction from the weakness thus brought about, and this reaction is almost invariably death to the tender plant. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Another unfavorable condition is the result of indiscriminate watering. The soil is either kept too wet or too dry. To grow good plants there must be an even supply of moisture. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A third unfortunate condition is the result of failure to give the plants a liberal supply of fresh air. It is possible, however, to overcome these conditions and grow really good plants from seed in the living-room, but it cannot be done unless the amateur gardener is sufficiently interested in the undertaking to give their plants all the attention they need. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Instead of keeping them in the living-room--which in most instances will have a temperature of 79 or 80°--I would advise giving them place in a room opening off the sitting-room, where the temperature can be so regulated that it will not go above 65° at any time. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There is far less danger of plants suffering from a low temperature than of their being injured by an excess of heat. If the room in which they are kept has snug windows, in most instances it will get all the warmth that is needed by leaving open at night the door which connects it with the living-room. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If the weather is very cold, the plants can be removed, temporarily, to the living-room, or they can be covered with newspapers. Thick paper shades at the windows will do much to keep out cold and prevent draughts. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Storm-sash will do this most effectively, but it interferes with giving the young plants the fresh air they need. Therefore I would prefer the shades, and depend upon removal to a warmer place on extra-cold nights. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Fresh air will be found a most important factor in the growth of seedling plants indoors. Unless it can be given it will be almost impossible to grow any plant well in the ordinary dwelling. It should be admitted to the room on every pleasant day by opening a window at the top, or a door at some distance from the plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The fresh, cold air should be allowed to mix with the warm air in the room before it comes in contact with the plants, as a chill will often do about as much damage as a touch of frost. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Watering these plants is a matter of prime importance. Generally water is applied carelessly and irregularly--too much today, and none at all tomorrow. We saturate the soil with it while only enough is required to make it moist. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> An over-supply of water at the roots, combined with too much heat and lack of fresh air, will undermine the constitution of any plant, because such a combination excites unnatural development, and this means a lowering of the vital force to the danger-point. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I have devised a method by which I have succeeded in controlling the supply of moisture in the soil to my complete satisfaction. I use boxes about four inches deep to start my plants in. In the bottom of these boxes I put sphagnum moss. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There should be at least an inch of it after it has been pressed down by the weight of the soil above. The bottom of the seed-box is bored full of small holes. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Each box sets in a shallow pan of galvanized iron, on a layer of coarse gravel, which raises it enough to allow water to circulate freely under it. Water is poured into the iron pan, using enough to come up about half an inch above the bottom of the seed-box, or in contact with the moss in it, and it should be kept at this height at all times. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The moss absorbs the moisture like a sponge, and the soil above constantly sucks up all that is needed to keep it in a sufficiently moist condition to meet the requirements of the plants growing in it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The absorbent qualities of the moss are such that an excessive amount of moisture is never communicated to the soil above. Thus I secure a steady and even supply, which does away entirely with the danger resulting from the application of water to the surface of the soil from watering-pot or basin. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If the temperature can be controlled in such a way that it will not vary much from 60 to 65°, if the soil can be kept moist but never wet, and fresh air can be given in generous quantity regularly, it will be found a comparatively easy matter to grow plants satisfactorily from seed in the house. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> You can have them in such healthy condition by the time it is safe to put them out in the garden that they will average up well with the plants the professional gardener raises in hotbed and cold-frame. By the use of such plants, and such plants only, can we expect to grow early vegetables successfully. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> VII. STANDARD VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The amateur gardener will find it extremely perplexing work to make a satisfactory selection of varieties of vegetables to grow in their garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> They know quite well, as a general thing, what kinds they want to grow, but when they come to a consultation of the seedsmen\'s catalogues they discover that of each kind of vegetable listed therein there are so many varieties mentioned that they are bewildered. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Most of them are described as being so desirable that they cannot help getting the impression that if they rule out this or that one they are likely to deprive themselves of the very thing from which they would obtain the highest degree of satisfaction. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Nine times out of ten they find, after going through the catalogues and marking the kinds and varieties that appeal to them most forcibly, that they have a list which would furnish enough seed to supply an average-sized market-garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I would advise the amateur gardener to attempt the culture of only a few of the many varieties described in the catalogues, and these of the very best. But what constitutes "the very best" is a hard matter for them to decide where all are described by adjectives in the superlative degree. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> He will find, by comparing the catalogues of the various seed firms, that there are described in most of them certain varieties of each kind of vegetable that seem common to all, along with many other varieties whose names differ greatly, though the descriptions of them indicate that there is not much difference in quality, or in other general respects. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If they confine their selection to such varieties of each kind as the various dealers list under the same names in their catalogues they will be making no mistake, for the fact that all leading dealers carry these varieties in stock is sufficient proof that they are standard varieties, and of such superior merit that no up-to-date dealer can afford to exclude them from their list. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Take, for instance, Stowell\'s Evergreen sweet-corn, and Champion of England pea. All dealers handle these, because they are standard, and always in demand because their superior qualities have made them universal favorites wherever grown. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But they have other varieties of the same vegetable of which each makes a specialty, under names which will be found in no catalogue but their own. Many of these are doubtless possessors of all the good qualities claimed for them, but this we cannot be sure about. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But the sorts which are common to all are those of whose merit there can be no two opinions. These are the varieties the inexperienced gardener can select with the assurance that they are getting the best thing of its kind on the market. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In this chapter I propose to make mention of only such kinds of vegetables as I have grown in my own garden. I do this because so many beginners in gardening prefer to depend on the advice of some one who has familiarized themselves with the merits of the various vegetables adapted to ordinary gardening. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> And I propose to give with each such brief cultural directions as seem of most importance, thus making it possible for the amateur to avoid some of the mistakes that might be made if they were wholly ignorant of the requirements of their plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> After having experimented with many kinds I have pinned my faith to the kinds I shall make mention of, and I have no hesitancy in recommending them to the attention of all gardeners, feeling confident that a trial of them will bear me out in the statement that no better list can be made. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There  may  be others of equal or superior merit, but if there are I have still to find out what they are. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Asparagus_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Taking the list alphabetically, the first vegetable to consider is asparagus. Conover\'s Colossal seems to combine all the merits of the several varieties on the market in such a degree as to give it a place at the head of the list of desirable kinds for ordinary garden culture. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is tender, fine-flavored, and very productive. A dozen plants, after becoming well established, will furnish all that will be required by a family of four or five persons. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In order to secure good crops of this delicious vegetable it will be necessary to dig up the soil in which it is to be planted to the depth of two or three feet, and fill the bottom of the excavation with strong manure. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Pack this down firmly, and then return to the trench the soil thrown out from it, fertilizing this well as you do so. While asparagus will grow in a soil that is not at all rich, and will live on indefinitely under all kinds of neglect and abuse, it must be given plenty of strong food and good care in order to enable it to do itself justice. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I would not advise attempting to grow it from seed, as it takes a long time for seedling plants to reach maturity. I would get two- or three-year-old plants. Set them about eighteen inches apart and at least four inches below the surface. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Keep weeds and grass away from them. Give the asparagus-bed a place in the garden by itself, preferably along a fence or in some location where it will not interfere with other plants which call for the frequent use of the garden-cultivator. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> On no account plant it in that part of the garden where it will be necessary to use a plow, for it is a plant that must be left undisturbed if you would have it do its best. Cover the beds with coarse manure in the fall, and work this into the soil about the plants in spring. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Beans_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Mammoth Stringless Green Pod matures early, and is very tender, fine-flavored, and productive. It is a general favorite for the home garden. Golden Wax is later than the green-podded variety mentioned above. It is valuable as a string-bean, and for shelling. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Beans are quite tender, therefore they should not be planted until the weather becomes warm and settled. Plant in rows two feet apart, and about four inches apart in the row, or in hills of three or four plants each. Cultivate frequently during the early part of summer, throwing the soil toward the plants. Do not work among them while they are wet from dew or rain. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If a pole-bean is wanted, Improved Lima will be found extremely satisfactory because of its productiveness and its fine, buttery flavor. This class supplies the table with shelled beans only, its pods being too tough to use as a string-bean. Plant in hills of six or eight, setting a pole six or seven feet tall in the center of each hill for the plants to climb by. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Beet_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I would advise two varieties of this vegetable where the garden is large enough to warrant the use of more than one. Crosby\'s Egyptian stands at the head of the list as an early variety. It is remarkably tender, and has a sugary flavor that is most delicious. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> As a second variety I would advise Crimson Globe. This is very sweet and fine-flavored, and comes to perfection during the latter part of summer. It is a good keeper, and a quantity of it should be stored in the cellar for winter use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Sow seeds in rows sixteen to eighteen inches apart. Sow thickly, and use the surplus plants as greens while young and tender, making use of both top and root. Thin to three or four inches apart. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Cabbage_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Unless the garden is of considerable size I would not advise planting this vegetable, because it takes up so much room that might better be given to other kinds which you will find more useful. The plants should stand at least two feet apart. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Seed can be put into the ground about the first of May, or plants can be started in the hotbed if wanted for very early use. Seedlings can be transplanted as soon as they have made their second leaf. For a very early variety I would advise Jersey Wakefield. For late use Late Drumhead or Stone Mason Marblehead--both excellent in all respects, and fine for winter use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Care must be taken to prevent insects from injuring the plants during the various stages of their development. Spray with an infusion of the tobacco extract known as Nicoticide. This will effectually prevent the pests from doing harm if applied thoroughly and frequently. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If cabbage is to be wintered in the cellar, it must be kept cool and dry. Some prefer to bury the heads in trenches, in dry locations in the garden. The trench should be about two feet deep. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Spread straw in the bottom of it, and place the cabbage on it, head down, with the large leaves folded well together. Then cover with three or four inches of hay, and bank up with soil. Put a board over this to shed rain. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The cabbage will freeze, but if left in the ground until the frost is gradually extracted from it it will be found crisp and brittle, and much more satisfactory for table use than that which is wintered in the cellar. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Care must be taken to exclude rain. If water gets to it it will be ruined. It is a good plan to cover the trench with oilcloth or tarred paper, both being waterproof. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Cauliflower_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This is a favorite vegetable when well grown and properly cared for. It requires a rich soil, a location well exposed to the sun, and frequent applications of water if the season happens to be a dry one. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Cultivate as you would cabbage. For early use the plants should be started in the hotbed, and transplanted to the cold-frame as soon as they have made their third leaves. Put into the open ground as soon as the soil is in good working condition. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Set the plants about two feet apart. When heads have formed they should be bleached by drawing the large leaves together and tying them with strips of soft cloth. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> For a late crop, to mature during the pickling season, start plants in open ground in May. The best early variety is Dwarf Erfurt. Autumn Giant is an excellent late variety. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Carrot_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This plant likes a deep, warm, sandy soil. Early Short Horn matures by midsummer. It is rich and sweet in flavor. Red Intermediate is a later variety, excellent for fall and winter use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Comparatively few persons give this plant a place in their gardens, but it richly deserves a place there because of its value as an article of food, as well as because of its health-giving qualities. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It adds greatly to the variety of the bill of fare, and where it appears frequently on the table a liking for it is soon developed, and thereafter it becomes a standard vegetable in the cook\'s list of "must-haves." It adds a delightful flavor to vegetable soups. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Celery_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The seed of early celery should be sown in the hotbed. Transplant the seedlings to the cold-frame and allow them to remain there until May. Then set in the richest soil at your disposal, six inches apart in the row. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Blanch by setting up boards a foot or more in width each side the row, allowing an opening about three inches wide at the top through which the plants can get a little light. For late and winter use, sow the seeds in open ground in May. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Bleach by earthing up gradually, as the stalks develop, until you have the plants buried to within a few inches of the tip of their leaves. Use clean, dry soil in banking the plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Sawdust is good, but care must be taken to make use of a kind that does not have a strong odor. Pine-dust will give the plants a disagreeable flavor. For winter use, take up plants, root and all, and pack close together in boxes and store in a cool, dark cellar. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> White Plume is the best early variety. Giant Pascal is probably the most satisfactory winter variety, but Winter Queen is a favorite with many. Both are so tender and have such a rich, nutty flavor that it is not an easy matter to decide between them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Cucumber_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> For very early cucumbers plant the seed in the hotbed in March or April, but do not put the plants into the garden until all danger of frost is over. This plant requires a rich and mellow soil. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It should be set in hills at least four feet apart. It is a good plan to start the seed in pieces of sod placed grass-side down. This enables one to move them from the hotbed without any disturbance of their roots. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The cucumber- or squash-beetle often destroys the plants when they are put in the open ground if close watch is not taken and prompt effort made to rout the enemy. Spray with Nicoticide infusion, taking pains to have it reach the under side of the leaves. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Dry road-dust sifted thickly over the plants is often found quite effective, but because of the inability to apply it to the under side of the leaves the liquid insecticide will be found more effective. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Improved Early White Spine is a favorite with all who like a crisp, tender-meated, finely flavored cucumber. Ever-bearing is an excellent sort for pickling as well as for use on the table during the fall, as it continues to bear until frost kills the vines. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> _Corn_ </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Sweet-corn is one of the most delicious of all garden vegetables, and every garden that is large enough to admit of its culture should give place to two or three varieties of it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Because of its tall growth and the distance required between rows it is not adapted to culture in the very small garden, though I would willingly go without some of the other vegetables generally grown there in order to give place to a few hills of it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Golden Bantam produces ears only four or five inches in length, but what they lack in size they make up for in tenderness and sweetness. Country Gentleman is a medium variety, very tender, sweet, and juicy. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But the ideal sweet-corn is Stowell\'s Evergreen. No other variety equals it in tenderness, sugary sweetness, and rich flavor. It does not come to maturity until quite late in the season, but it remains in excellent eating-condition until the plant is killed by frost. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> VIII. SMALL FRUITS AND THEIR CULTURE </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Quite as important as garden vegetables is the small-fruit department of each home that is living up to its privileges. Of course there will be no room for raspberries and blackberries on the little home lot, but one can have a row of strawberries there, in almost all cases. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A few currant-bushes can be tucked away in nooks and corners where quite likely nothing else would be grown if the tiny space were not given up to them. There are places all over the country where a collection of small fruit ought to be grown, but which are without it. Why? </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There are several answers to the question. One is: Neglect to live up to the possibilities of the place because of carelessness, or possibly because the owner is distrustful of their ability to grow them successfully. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Another is: The impression that these plants are so exacting in their demands that none but skilled gardeners are warranted in undertaking their culture. And a third one is: The uncertainty of being unable to take them through our severe Northern winters safely. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The first objection is met with the argument that the person who is obliged to work for a living, and has a family to support, has no excuse for neglecting to avail themselves and those dependent on him of all the good things that can be grown from the plants named, if they own a piece of ground large enough to accommodate a small collection. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The second objection is not justified, because it is an easy matter for any man to learn how to care for small fruits if they set about it with the intention of mastering its details. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There is really no basis in fact for the third one, for we have, today, varieties of each kind of small fruit that are entirely hardy at the North if properly cared for in the fall. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There should be a strawberry-bed, large or small, in every garden, if I had my way about it. Here I suppose some reader will meet me with the objection that "strawberries don\'t pay. They require too much care, and the beds soon run out, and then everything has to be done over again." </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Now I claim that strawberries do pay if they get the right kind of treatment. No one has a right to expect much from them if he simply sticks a plant into the soil and leaves it to take care of itself thereafter. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Strawberries cultivated in this manner don\'t pay, I admit. And it is well that they do not, for no one has a right to expect much, if anything, from a plant of any kind that he isn\'t willing to take good care of. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> While the strawberry will not take care of itself, it really requires no more attention than most other crops. And as to "running out," that cuts no figure, when you come to think about it, because "doing things all over again" amounts to no more than planting vegetables each season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This has to be done yearly, and strawberries will demand only annual attention, thus putting the two classes of plants on practically the same basis. I am aware that some writers on strawberry culture have ventilated a good many far-fetched ideas of their own in print relative to the culture of this plant. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> So elaborate and complicated are some of these theories that many an amateur has, after reading them, abandoned the idea of having a strawberry-bed. But it is a fact susceptible of proof by anyone who gives it a trial that strawberry culture may be made a success without adopting the views of persons who seem to think that theory is more important than common sense. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The simplest method of strawberry-growing that I know anything about is what is called the "one-crop system." Set the plants in rows three feet apart, to allow the use of the cultivator between them. Let the plants be a foot apart in the row. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Keep the ground between the rows well cultivated, and in the second summer, when the plants are bearing their first crop of fruit, allow them to send their runners into the space between the rows and take root there. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> When these young plants have fully established themselves--which will be by the end of August, as a general thing--take a spade and cut down between them and the old plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Then dig up the old plants, making the place where they grew a space between rows. Next season train runners from the bearing plants back into the old row. By thus alternating the location of the plants you keep the garden supplied with one-year-old ones from which you get but one crop of fruit. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This method is so simple that any one can understand it, and it has the endorsement of some of our most up-to-date gardeners who recognize the fact that one full crop of berries is about all that can be expected from the strawberry. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Of course older plants will bear fruit, but never of the quantity and quality which is obtained from strong, healthy young plants whose vitality has not been drawn upon by the production of a heavy first crop. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This one-crop system makes it possible to grow fine berries without giving the plants more care than is required by ordinary vegetables. The soil for strawberries should be rich and mellow, and should be kept entirely free from weeds. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is a good plan to spread clean straw between the rows before the crop ripens, to keep the fruit from coming in contact with the ground or having sand washed upon it by heavy rains. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The best variety of strawberry that I have ever grown is Brandywine. It is very productive, bears large berries, has a most delicious flavor, and is never hollow-hearted. It ripens in mid-season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The best late variety, allowing me to be judge, is Gandy. This kind requires a very rich soil. Where it can be given this, no more satisfactory late-cropper can be grown.

'<p class=cent> Several times in the last few years the announcement has been made that a fall-bearing strawberry has been produced, but as it was of European origin it did not prove satisfactory under American conditions. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Of late, however, some of our most progressive small-fruit growers have succeeded in growing two varieties that promise to be really good fall-croppers.

'<p class=cent> But in order to secure a good crop late in the season it is advisable to cut away all buds that appear in June, keeping the strength of the plant in reserve for the fall crop. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> The blackberry responds generously to good treatment, bearing enormous quantities of large, juicy berries of most delicious flavor when given proper care. It prefers a rather sandy soil. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In order to secure a fresh stock of wood for each season\'s crop the old canes should be cut away as soon as they have ripened their fruit, thus throwing all the strength of the plant into the production of new canes from which fruit is to be expected next season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> While the two leading varieties, Kittatinny and Snyder, are quite hardy, it is well to take the precaution of giving them some protection to guard against the possible loss of some of the unripened growth of the season. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This is done to the best advantage by removing two or three spadefuls of soil from the base of each plant, close to its roots, and then tipping the bush over until it lies flat on the ground. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This could not be done without running the risk of breaking some of the stiff and brittle canes if the excavation were not made.

'<p class=cent> The currant is one of the garden\'s indispensables.

'<p class=cent> No kind of small fruit is easier to grow successfully.

'<p class=cent> The currant is one of the most valued fruits for jam- and jelly-making. One enterprising dealer has recently introduced to this country a French sort known as Bar-le-Duc, or Preserving Currant. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This variety has a flavor that no other variety can lay claim to, and another feature of merit peculiar to it is that it is almost seedless.

'<p class=cent> The gooseberry must not be overlooked in this connection. Many persons claim that the bush mildews to such an extent that the crop is oftener than not a failure.

'<p class=cent> The writer has tried both methods, and he has always been most successful when plants were put out in April and May, provided they were sent from the nursery that spring.

'<p class=cent> In order to have vegetables early in the season it will be necessary to give them a start some weeks before the ground is in proper condition for the reception of seed. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Sometimes this is done by sowing the seed in pots and boxes in the living-room, as advised in Chapter VI, but here conditions are not very favorable to healthy growth, unless great care is taken to follow the directions given in the chapter mentioned, and even then success does not always attend our efforts. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In order to give our plants the early start that they must have if we want vegetables at a time when most gardeners are getting the garden ready for planting, we must make use of the hotbed. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If this is done we can gain from six weeks to two months in time, and have lettuce and radishes before our neighbors who are without hotbed facilities consider it safe to put seed into the ground. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> At the North the first of March is quite early enough to get the hotbed under way. I am aware that many young gardeners have the impression that a hotbed is, in some respects, a mysterious thing, and because of this they do not undertake to make one. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Now there is nothing simpler than a hotbed when you come to a study of it. It is simply making a place in which summer conditions can be imitated by supplying it with steady, gentle heat, and in confining this heat within an inclosure. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The heat is generated by the use of material which ferments, and the inclosure is nothing but a combination of boards and glass so arranged that the temperature inside it can be regulated to suit the requirements of the plants you undertake to grow in it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The heat-generating material is generally fresh manure from the horse-stable, or a mixture of that and coarse litter. Because the heat from rapid fermentation is quite intense, at first the material from which it is obtained should be prepared before the hotbed is brought into use. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A quantity of it should be spread on the site selected for the hotbed--which should be one that is high and dry--covering a space larger than the hotbed frame is to be. Spread it in layers four or five inches deep, tramping each layer down well. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> When there is a foot and a half of it, cover it with something that will shed rain, and wait for fermentation to take place. A warm moisture will rise from it like steam. After two or three days fork the material over, and remove all straw, and make another heap similar to the first one, taking great pains to have it firm and compact. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It is very important that it should have considerable solidity, as a heap of loose litter will never give satisfactory results. There should be at least a foot and a half of this heat-generating material. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> While waiting for fermentation to take place in the manure-pile, prepare the frame for your hotbed. Let it be about a foot and a half in depth at the back, and eight or ten inches deep in front, with sides that slope from the wider boards to the narrower ones. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Cover it with glass set in sash. If possible have the sash hinged to the back-board, so that it can be lifted for ventilation without removing it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The best location for a hotbed is one facing the south, that all possible advantage can be taken of sunshine, and against a building or fence that will protect it on the north from cold winds. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Some persons prefer to make an excavation a foot or more in depth for the reception of the heating material, but this is not a matter of much importance. As a general thing it will not be possible to do this in a satisfactory manner while there is frost in the ground, as there will be at the North until after the first of March. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> When the first stages of fermentation are over, set the hotbed frame in place, and fill in with five or six inches of very fine, rich soil. This is what your seed is to be planted in. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The young gardener will be surprised at the amount of heat contained in an inclosure like the one described. It will be very similar to the weather conditions of early or middle May out of doors. In it plants will grow healthily and vigorously, provided they are given plenty of fresh air. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> This is a matter of the greatest importance. Unless your seedlings are aired daily, if the weather is pleasant, they will make a rapid but weak growth, and when the time comes to put them in the cold-frame or the open ground--provided they are alive then--they will be so lacking in vitality that the change will be pretty sure to put an end to them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> On every sunny or warm day the sash should be lifted an inch or two, about ten o\'clock, and left in that condition until about two. Care must be taken, however, to see that the wind does not blow from a quarter that will drive the cold air in upon the plants. The admission of a cold blast will often be fatal to the tender plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Great caution must be exercised in regard to ventilation. The aim should be, at all times, to admit pure, fresh air without allowing cold to enter with it. This may seem a somewhat paradoxical statement, for at first thought it will seem impossible for air from without to come in without taking along with it the cold air which is in circulation outside. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> But when one takes into consideration the fact that the warm air inside the hotbed meets the air from out of doors at the point of entrance it will be understood that it repels or counteracts it to an extent that makes it safe to open the sash slightly when the outside temperature is nearly down to freezing-point. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The hotbed-owner must study existing conditions and be governed accordingly. It is impossible to lay down any hard-and-fast rules to apply in this case. On cold nights the hotbed sash should be covered with blankets or old carpeting to prevent the formation of frost on the glass. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If you find, in the morning, that the glass is covered with moisture on its under side, raise the sash a trifle and leave it so until the moisture clears away. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If at any time you have reason to think that the warmth inside the frame is decreasing too rapidly, bank up about it with fresh fermenting material. After constructing the hotbed and putting the frame and sash in place, test the heat inside by an accurate thermometer before venturing to sow any seed. When it registers 85° or 90° the bed is ready for seeding. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In making the frame for a hotbed care should be taken to see that all joints fit snugly. A great deal of cold can be admitted through a very small crevice. A few cracks will let out the heat faster than it is generated, therefore see to it that in constructing the frame a good piece of work is done. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Some persons tell me that they always bank up a hotbed with earth.This enables it to retain the heat better than it is possible for it to do without banking. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A hotbed will be of no particular benefit unless supplemented by a cold-frame. This is simply a snug inclosure of boards covered with glass, into which plants from the hotbed are to be set for the purpose of hardening them off before they are put into the open ground. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In other words, it is a hotbed without heat. The temperature in it ought to register from 60° to 65°. Raise the sash an inch or two on sunny days before the rays of the sun striking on the glass raise the temperature inside to a degree too intense for the good of your plants. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It will be readily understood from what I have said above that in order to attain success in the management of a hotbed great care will have to be exercised at all times and frequent attention given. It is not a self-regulating thing by any means. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> You will have to consider the weather, the time of day when ventilation should be given, frequency of watering, and other matters which cannot be touched on here because of a more or less local character. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Plants in the hotbed should be watered cautiously. An over-supply will often cause the seedlings to "damp off," and a lack of sufficient moisture at the roots will speedily result in injury, if not death. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Whenever water is applied, use a sprinkler that throws a fine spray. If thrown on the soil in a stream the water will often wash the smaller plants out of place. It may puzzle one to tell when just enough has been given. This is best determined by an examination of the soil. If moderately moist there is plenty of moisture below. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> Here is where they make a mistake. A garden need not be a large one to be enjoyable. A few plants are better than none. It is possible to make a bit of garden more satisfactory than a large one because it will be more likely to get more attention than would be given to the larger one, and attention is one of the important features of any successful garden. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There will, in the majority of cases, be little nooks and corners here and there about the home grounds in which some plants can be grown by those disposed to make the most of existing conditions. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> These, if not improved, will be pretty sure to be given over to weeds, or to the accumulation of rubbish of one kind or another, and they will detract from the tidy and clean appearance which should characterize the home everywhere. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> There can be no real and lasting improvement in civic undertaking unless the individual home takes up the matter. The civic improvement society that starts out with the idea of improving things generally, but does not begin the good work _at the home_ is working on the idea of making clean the outside of the cup and ignoring the condition inside it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> Because the scattered places about the small home in which few plants could be grown will not admit of bed-making, or the "designs" which many persons seem to think indispensable in gardening, is no good reason why we should not take advantage of and make the most of them. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> There are more ways than one to secure fertilizers and fine soil for the small garden. If sward is cut from the roadside, chopped into small pieces, and stored away in some corner of the yard that is convenient to get at, and the soapsuds are poured over it each week, it will, in a short time, if stirred frequently, become a most excellent substitute for leaf-mold. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',

'<p class=cent> This answers very well as long as the weather remains dry, but as soon as a rain-storm comes along the twine absorbs so much moisture that it relaxes its tension and sags in such a manner as to endanger the vines which have taken hold of it. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Coarse-meshed wire netting will be found much more satisfactory, as it will not sag and cannot be blown down by winds.

'<p class=cent> Too often we neglect our gardens until they are in such a debilitated condition that we get but slight returns from them, and then we set to work to make them all over, and in this way we fail to get as much out of them as we ought to. By planting something each season we keep them up to bearing-point, and have no "off seasons." </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> I wonder how many people who may read this little book have ever dried sweet-corn for winter use. Not many, I think. But if they were to do so one season I am quite confident that thereafter they would not willingly be without a generous supply of it, for it will be found far more delicious than the ordinary canned article. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In drying it, some cook it for a few minutes, and then cut it from the cob and spread it out on plates to dry. Others do not think it worth while to cook it, but cut it from the cob as soon as gathered, and dry it by first putting it in the oven for a few minutes before exposing it to the sun to dry. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The little time in the oven is equivalent to the partial cooking spoken of. Turn it on the plates on which it is spread every day, and do not consider it dry enough to store away until it appears to have parted with all its moisture </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Then put it into paper bags or glass jars, and set away in a cool, dark place to remain until you desire to use it. Soak it for two or three hours before putting it on the stove to cook. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> When properly cooked it will be tender and have a more delicious flavor than canned corn. The generous use of butter and cream will make it a dish that is fit to set before a king. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Those who happen to live in places where it is not possible to have cellars, because of low ground, can have places in which to store vegetables for winter use that are really preferable to the ordinary cellar, by constructing what might be called a shed, for want of a better name. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Build up a wall four or five feet high, and bank up about it with so much earth that frost cannot penetrate it. Cover with a roof that will keep out cold and rain. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Have a doorway opening into it from an entry into which we can step and close one door behind us before we open the one that lets us into the place where our vegetables are. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Such a room can be constructed with but little expense. Because of its being above ground it will be drier than a cellar, and in the majority of cases it will be more convenient to get at. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> It should be boarded up with a good quality of matched boarding, and its walls should be lined with two or three thicknesses of sheathing paper put on in such a manner as to show no cracks or openings. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> The best place for a vegetable-garden is where the soil is naturally well drained and where there is a slope to the south. Such a slope enables it to get the full benefit of sunshine, and sunshine, it will be found, is an important factor in successful gardening. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If such an exposure is out of the question, aim to make conditions as favorable as possible. A closely boarded fence on the north side of a garden affords excellent protection from cold winds early in the season, and helps greatly in keeping away frost in fall, when many plants are maturing. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Mention is made in the above paragraph of good drainage. This is quite important. If the soil of a garden is not well drained, many kinds of vegetables cannot be grown in it, and few will attain to even a partial degree of success. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Therefore see to it that by ditching, or the use of tile, all surplus water is properly disposed of. Much good can be done to a heavy soil by adding to it sharp, coarse sand, old mortar--anything that will have a tendency to counteract the heaviness resulting from undue retention of water or a naturally too close character of soil. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> If sand is obtainable, and your garden is one in which clay predominates, use it in generous quantities. You will find it as beneficial as manure. Spread it over the surface before plowing or spading, and work it in thoroughly. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> A few seasons\' application will bring about a very marked change for the better in any garden whose soil cannot be made fine and mellow without the addition of some disintegrating matter. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> Good drainage must be secured in order to grow good vegetables, and the use of tile will be found a most effective remedy for the evil of a soil unduly retentive of moisture. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
'<p class=cent> In almost all localities there will be families who have no garden, but who would make liberal use of vegetables if they were easily procurable.

'<p class=cent> I don\'t know that they will become professional gardeners, but they will be learning something as well as earning something while they are fitting themselves for whatever occupation in life they may decide on, and what they learn in the garden will be of benefit in after-life in more ways than one. </p> <p class=bottom> [Press spacebar to advance to next page or backspace to return to previous page] </p>',
