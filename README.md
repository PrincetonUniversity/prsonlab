Please take a few minutes to document your additions in the wiki, and make sure your scripts have comments in them.
It is helpful to at least include the following in both your script and the wiki: description of the script, input arguments, output, what version of software you worked with (e.g. python3.4, matlab 2015b, jspsych-5.0.3), and the author (in case someone has a question about it).
